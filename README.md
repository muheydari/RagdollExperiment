# Ragdoll Physics Game

A fun interactive 3D ragdoll physics game built with React Three Fiber and Cannon.js physics engine.

**Available as both a web application and Windows desktop app!**

## Features

- Interactive ragdoll character that responds to mouse interactions
- Realistic physics simulation using Cannon.js
- 3D environment with furniture and objects
- Drag and drop mechanics
- Reflective floor surface
- Dynamic lighting and shadows

## Technologies Used

### Core Game Engine
- **React** - UI framework
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library  
- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **React Three Drei** - Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **Cannon.js** - Physics engine for realistic physics simulation

### Desktop App
- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop app framework
- **electron-builder** - Application packaging and distribution

## Getting Started

### ðŸŽ® Play the Game

#### Option 1: Windows Desktop App (Recommended)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Run `RagdollPhysics-Portable.exe` - no installation required!
3. Enjoy the game with native desktop performance

#### Option 2: Web Version (Development)
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ragdoll-physics
```

2. Install dependencies:
